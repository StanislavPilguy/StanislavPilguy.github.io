        <h2> SERVICES </h2>
        <p> Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary <br> time
            needed to understand your product vision. <br>
            The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work. <br>
            Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces <br> you need. </p>
